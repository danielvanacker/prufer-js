# prufer-js
Transform a Pr√ºfer sequence into an array of edges.

## Usage
```TS
const my_prufer_sequence = [4,3,0];
const edges = pruferLinearTime(my_prufer_sequence);
// edges = [[1, 4], [2, 3], [3, 0], [0, 4]]
```

## Credits
Originally, I was using [jleppert's js implementation](https://github.com/jleppert/prufer) of this algorithm but ran into some performance issues as the number of nodes in a tree grew (200,000 + nodes).

I found a [linear time implementation of the algorithm on cp-algorithms.com](https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/pruefer_code.html#prufer-code_1) in c++ so decided to implement that in TS and JS.
